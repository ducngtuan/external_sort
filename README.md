This is my solution for the first Assignment of "Datenbanksysteme und moderne CPU-Architekturen" (SS2013).

### How to build

The project is built with [cmake](http://www.cmake.org/). Go to the `build` folder and execute `cmake ..` from there.

    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make

The compiled executable files are stored in `build/bin`.
